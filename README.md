# degradr: Estimating Remaining Useful Life with Linear Mixed Effects Models
## Description
Provides tools to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of degrading systems using linear mixed effects models. Supports both univariate and multivariate degradation signals. For multivariate inputs, signals are fused into a univariate health index prior to modeling. Linear and exponential degradation paths are supported (the latter via a logarithmic transformation). Remaining Life Distributions (RLDs) are computed via Bayesian updating for new units, enabling in-situ predictive maintenance. Based on the methodology of Liu and Huang (2016) <doi:10.1109/TASE.2014.2349733>.
